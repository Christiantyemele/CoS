# Employee Clarification Questions (derived from `knowledge.csv` email-style threads)

These questions are designed to reduce ambiguity and speed up decisions. Use them when an employee message is unclear, missing context, or has implicit assumptions.

## Meetings + planning

- **Clarify goal**
  - What’s the specific outcome we want from this meeting—decision, alignment, or status update?

- **Agenda and format**
  - Can we switch from presentations to a roundtable format so each group shares what’s working/not working?

- **Who needs to attend**
  - Which teams are required vs optional? Can we limit to decision-makers + one representative per group?

- **Prep expectations**
  - Do you want slides, or just a written summary and talking points?

- **Decision ownership**
  - Who is the DRI for the final decision, and by when do we need the call?

## Forecasts + numbers

- **Definition check**
  - When you say “forecast”, do you mean best case, committed, or a range (e.g., P50/P90)?

- **Assumptions**
  - What assumptions are we using for inputs (pricing, volume, timing), and what changed since the last version?

- **Source of truth**
  - Which file/version is the official forecast? Can we lock one owner to publish weekly?

- **Reconciliation**
  - Can we list the top 3 drivers that explain the delta vs the last forecast?

## Travel + business meetings

- **Purpose**
  - Is this trip primarily for business planning, relationship-building, or both?

- **Efficiency**
  - Can we do the business plan meetings here first, then travel only if there’s still a clear need?

- **ROI / success criteria**
  - What would “success” look like for the trip, and how will we measure it?

## Cross-team execution

- **Blockers**
  - What’s the biggest blocker from each group right now, and what decision do you need from us?

- **Dependencies**
  - Which deliverables depend on other teams, and what’s the handoff format/date?

- **Communication**
  - Where should updates live—email thread, weekly doc, or a single shared tracker?

## Email hygiene / missing context

- **Missing subject**
  - Can you confirm the subject/topic for this thread so it’s searchable later?

- **Request clarity**
  - What’s the ask here—approve, review, or just FYI?

- **Time sensitivity**
  - Is this urgent? What’s the deadline?

## Recommended usage rules (simple)

- Ask **one** clarification question when the message is ambiguous.
- Ask **two** when the message triggers multiple unknowns (e.g., meeting + forecast + deadline).
- Prefer questions that:
  - Produce a decision owner + deadline.
  - Identify the source of truth.
  - Make assumptions explicit.
